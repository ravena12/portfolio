          <p>Hello! My name is Raven Anderson and I am a software developer! Programming has impacted all our lives in one shape or another. It's moving fast and changing how we live, and I want to be apart of that process. I see it in a way that lets me be creative while helping others.</p>
          <p>Outside of coding, I love doing a lot of different activities! Some things I enjoy doing are - hiking, skydiving, traveling, hanging with friends, and seeing movies! </p>
